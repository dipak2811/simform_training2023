      <h3>Designer, developer, and product strategist trying to move the needle.</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>I’ve been called a ‘pragmatic’ designer.
          I take that as a compliment.</li>
        <li>My professional work slants towards product design that can make a measurable impact.</li>
        <li> Usability over style. Stylish when called for.
        </li>
        <li>Learning from your customers and shipping delightful, yet useful tools for them is both
          rewarding and challenging, which is why I've been drawn to working with early products,
          especially those where you can get to know your users personally.
        </li>
        <li>I’ve had the privilege of working with some great teams on some truly impactful products,
          and have learned a thing or two along the way.</li>
        <li> I bring that experience to new ventures and try to share it with folks through mentoring
          and writing.
        </li>
        <li>
          I tend to think about design like a founder, because I’ve been one.</li>
        <li>
          Balancing process and instinct, the goal is to find harmony between user delight and
          business strategy, as fast as you can deliver quality.
          If this seems like your cup of tea, I'd be pleased to chat about your project needs. My
          availability is below.</li>
