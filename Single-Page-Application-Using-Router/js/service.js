                        1. Design is a measurable strategic asset.</h5>

                <label style="float: left;  ">
                    <p>Good design can contribute directly to an organization's bottom line. According to multiple
                        studies, organizations that value design consistently perform stronger on virtually all
                        financial measures.</p>

                <label style="float: left;">
                    <h5>2. Good design can make life better. </h5>
                </label>
                <label style="float: left;">
                    <p>From life-saving procedural instructions, to an easier-to-read ballot, to a more ergonomic
                        product: design that we interact with everyday has the potential to make people's lives better
                        (or worse). It is not simply an aesthetic treatment.</p>

                    <h5>3. Diversity in collaboration yields the best results.</h5>
                </label>
                <label style="float: left;">
                    <p>Our audiences are global. We live in an interconnected world where no one person has all of the
                        skills to make most of the products we use everyday. We need to work with partners who are
                        diverse in background and discipline to create better products, services and organizations for
                        the future.</p>

                        4. Technology should feel easy.</h5>
                </label>
                <label style="float: left;">
                    <p>Every user is different and one size should not fit all. The goal of interaction design is to
                        create products or interfaces that will work best for an intended user. That means it might have
                        to work equally well for many users with many different technologies—today's tech has to be
                        flexible and adaptable.</p>

                </label>
                <label style="float: left;">
                    <p>Understanding consumer behavior and knowing how to learn what a customer wants can work towards
                        the promotion of a social campaign just as effectively as it can promote a product. Harnessing
                        that power for the right reasons is a worthwhile endeavor.</p>

                    <h5>
                        6. Great brands aren’t just skin-deep.</h5>
                </label>
                <label style="float: left;">
                    <p>You can’t throw a new logo and website up and call it a brand refresh (that is, in fact, an
                        identity). Branding touches every facet of an organization and is reflected in everything an
                        organization does, meaning corporate ethos and responsibility are more important than the
                        design. </p>

                    <h5>7. Trusting relationships produce better work, faster.</h5>
                </label>
                <label style="float: left;">
                    <p>You trust me, I trust you; enough so that we both give honest opinions. This is how iteration
                        produces better results, faster. Without this trust, it's hard to produce meaningful results.
                        Trust takes effort, but it's worth it.</p>
